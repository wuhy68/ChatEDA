My project named "AutoDriver" on the "ams035" platform focuses on developing an integrated circuit for autonomous vehicles. For this, I need to run a series of processes while maximizing the chip's performance. During the synthesis phase, I want to set the clock period from 3 to 8 with a step of 1. Subsequently, during the floorplanning process, I'd like to adjust the core utilization between 70% and 90% in increments of 5%. Moving on, I aim to modify the placement density from 0.7 to 0.9 in steps of 0.05. For the clock tree synthesis, I plan to resolve 50% to 80% of timing violations, increasing in steps of 10%. After executing global and detailed routing, I want to obtain 'final' metrics for performance analysis. Can we automate this process?

My team and I are currently developing an ASIC project titled 'DataProcessingUnit' for data mining applications. We are utilizing the 'nangate45' platform for the project. Our primary objective is to optimize our design for the best score of performance, area and power metrics. We plan to achieve this by varying the clock period from 3 to 8 during synthesis, adjusting the core utilization to range from 50% to 85% during floorplanning, and changing the placement cell densities from 0.55 to 0.9. Additionally, we plan to fix approximately 60% of timing violations during clock tree synthesis. Once the detail routing stage is completed, we intend to extract the 'area' and 'power' performance metrics for analysis. We are keen to understand whether this approach will yield the desired results and if it is feasible to obtain the required metrics at the completion of the detail routing stage.
